Blogging about the science of beaches

## Purpose

The purpose of the repository is to support a blog on the science of beaches. To start, we'll mainly use the Issues list to document article ideas, assignments, and track any bugs we need to fix in the blog infrastructure. The blog itself will be hosted on Wordpress, a site that can have multiple users, that can facilitate collaboration with multiple writers.
